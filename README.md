# NetworkMananger-l2tp

NetworkManager-l2tp is a VPN plugin for NetworkManager 1.2 which provides
support for L2TP and L2TP/IPsec (i.e. L2TP over IPsec) connections.

For L2TP support, it uses xl2tpd ( https://www.xelerance.com/software/xl2tpd/ )

For IPsec support, it uses either of the following :
* Libreswan ( https://libreswan.org )
* strongSwan ( https://www.strongswan.org )

For further package dependencies and known issues, please see the Wiki :

## Debian-way buld package
Install dependences before continue

```
cd /path/to/network-mananger-l2tp
dpkg-source --before-build . && dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us -rfakeroot && dpkg-source --after-build .
```

## Building

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure  # (optional, see below)
    make

The default ./configure settings aren't reasonable and should be explicitly
overridden with ./configure arguments. In the configure examples below, you
may need to change the `--with-pppd-plugin-dir` value to an appropriate
directory that exists.

#### Debian and Ubuntu (AMD64, i.e. x86-64)

    ./configure \
      --disable-static --prefix=/usr \
      --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
      --libexecdir=/usr/lib/NetworkManager \
      --localstatedir=/var \
      --with-pppd-plugin-dir=/usr/lib/pppd/2.4.7

#### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (x86-64)

    ./configure \
      --disable-static --prefix=/usr \
      --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib64 \
      --localstatedir=/var \
      --with-pppd-plugin-dir=/usr/lib64/pppd/2.4.7

## Running

#### L2TP with optional IPsec enabled

Stop any xl2tpd service (or other l2tp daemon), this should allow
NetworkManager-l2tp to start its own xl2tpd child process that needs UDP port
1701 to be free.

For Systemd based Linux distributions, issue the following to stop the xl2tpd
service and disable it from starting at boot time:

    sudo systemctl stop xl2tpd
    sudo systemctl disable xl2tpd

#### VPN servers using broken IPsec IKEv1 cipher suites

The following has recommendations on algorithms that are broken in regards
to security and should not be used :
* https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/SecurityRecommendations

The current list of broken algorithms and Diffie Hellman groups can be found here :
* https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IKEv1CipherSuites

strongSwan 5.4.0 dropped the following phase 1 (IKE) cipher suites as defaults:
    aes128-sha1-modp2048,3des-sha1-modp1536

and for phase 2 (ESP), strongSwan 5.4.0 dropped :
    aes128-sha1,3des-sha1

Older versions of NetworkManager-l2tp also used 3des-sha1-modp1024 for phase 1.

User specified phase 1 (ike) and phase 2 (esp) cipher suites that supplement
the default strongSwan or Libreswan cipher suites can be specified in the
IPsec configuration dialog box under Advanced options.

For example if you have no control of the cipher suites the VPN server uses
and you must use the same cipher suites as strongSwan 5.4.0 did when using a
later versions of strongSwan, enter the following in the corresponding IPsec
configuration dialog text boxes:

* Phase1 Algorithms : aes128-sha1-modp2048,3des-sha1-modp1536
* Phase2 Algorithms : aes128-sha1,3des-sha1

Please see the following for the `ike` (phase 1) and `esp` (phase2alg)
directives' syntax for cipher suites:

* https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/ConnSection
* https://libreswan.org/man/ipsec.conf.5.html

## Debugging

Issue the following on the command line which will increase xl2tpd and pppd
debugging :

#### Debian and Ubuntu
    sudo killall -TERM nm-l2tp-service
    sudo /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-l2tp-service --debug

#### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    sudo killall -TERM nm-l2tp-service
    sudo /usr/libexec/nm-l2tp-service --debug

then start your VPN connection and reproduce the problem.

NetworkManager and pppd logging goes to the Systemd journal which can be viewed
by issuing the following which will show the logs since the last boot:
    journalctl --boot

For non-Systemd based Linux distributions, view the appropriate system log
file which is most likely located under `/var/log/`.
