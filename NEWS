NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.6
Overview of changes since network-manager-l2tp-1.2.6
=======================================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager-l2tp.  Notable changes include:

* If L2TP port 1701 is already in use, no longer writes
  "leftprotoport=udp/l2tp" (which is equivalent to "leftprotoport=udp/1701") to
  the ipsec config file. This was done to ensures L2TP is encapsulated in IPsec
* Uses UUID instead of PID for run-time generated filenames
* IPsec rekeying is now possible because the following file remains for the
  life of the VPN connection :
    /etc/ipsec.d/nm-l2tp-ipsec-UUID.secrets
* Following two lines are added to /etc/ipsec.secrets if include line is
  missing:
    # Following line was added by NetworkManager-l2tp
    include /etc/ipsec.d/*.secrets
* Removed IPsec Group Name from user interface
* Added IPsec Phase 1 (ike) & Phase 2 (esp) to user interface
* New timeout code for IPsec connection up script.
  Asynchronously spawns IPsec connection up script then polls to determine
  when or if it exits within a 10 second timeout
